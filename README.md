# Priority_Queue
The following folder includes my source code for implementation of a priority queue along with the corresponding JUnit tests. I used the EclEmma Eclipse plugin during my own development to collect code coverage data. I got 100% code coverage. 

I followed the instructions to get the JaCoCo report showing the final code coverage achieved on tux. I got 100% statement coverage.

All operations in my code are producing the correct output.  

To run the tests, simply execute
gradle test
in a shell (or use your IDE’s support).  To get code coverage for the tests, run
       gradle test jacocoTestReport
